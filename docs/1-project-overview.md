# 1 Project Overview

> **Mission:** Find the rare timing and message-order faults in Ford’s remote-start protocol before they reach the road.

## 1.1 What is the RL Fuzz Bot?

Imagine your phone sending “remote-start” commands to your car’s engine module through a chain of gateways and switches. A tiny timing glitch or an unexpected command order can cause a failure. The RL Fuzz Bot is a self-improving test harness that learns to poke at that chain in thousands of ways, and finds the edge-case errors automatically.

- **Fuzzing:** We generate lots of random command sequences.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** A smart agent studies which sequences actually break things and focuses its efforts there.

Together, they cover both **breadth** (wide random coverage) and **depth** (targeted exploration).

## 1.2 Why combine RL & fuzz testing?

1. **Baseline coverage:** Random fuzzing finds the edge-cases.
2. **Guided exploration:** Reinforcement Learning spots patterns (“START → POLL → HEARTBEAT often times out”) and zooms in.
3. **Faster bug discovery:** We uncover deep-protocol faults that pure randomness would likely miss.

## 1.3 Why Ford?

This project mirrors real Ford hardware:

- **Latency models** mimic CAN/LIN jitter during cold-start scenarios.
- **Error-injection** simulates electrical noise on the vehicle’s gateway bus.
- **Action space** (START, CANCEL, POLL, HEARTBEAT) matches the commands used in Ford’s remote-start API.

By catching the rare faults, we protect millions of vehicles.
